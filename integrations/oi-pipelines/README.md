## OI Pipeline

This directory contains the Python code which implements a working example of a pipeline, for OpenLIT instrumentation in Open WebUI.
By importing and using this pipeline, you'll receive telemetry data straight from the OpenLIT SDK.
The code is an example, and further improvements are required if you want to use this on production (handling config changes and chat memory, for example).
